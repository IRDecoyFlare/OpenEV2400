## Introduction

The [EV2400](https://www.ti.com/tool/EV2400) is a toolset for programming and debug BQ series devices manufactured by Texas Instruments. The EV2400 is the EV2300's successor. Compared to the EV2300, the EV2400 has higher compatibility with newer systems and chips. Several designs are  available in the lib:

- **EV2400 Original** _[most similar to TI's EV2400-EVM]_(Figure.1)

- **EV2400 Low Cost** (Figure.2)

- **EV2400 Inexpensive** (Figure.3)

- **EV2400 Affordable** _[A CRAZY THING available for purchase on TaoBao]_(Figure.4)
